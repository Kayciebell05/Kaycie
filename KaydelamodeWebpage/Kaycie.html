<h2> Bio: </h2>

<p>Hey Fashionista! <strong>Do you really realllllly have a passion for fashion?!</strong> Well if you do, you have come to the right place. Just to introduce myself, my name is Kaycie Bell. I am 15 years old
  and currently attend Dutchtown High School. I am an aspiring fashion designer and currently own
   a fashion company called <strong>KAY DE LA MODE!</strong>. I started sewing
    when I was in the 5th grade and I have continued to increase my passion for
    fashion. My biggest role model today for fashion is Yara Shahidi. She has taught me to be different, be edgy, and be yourself. Right now, I currently do alterations and sew clothes for a company.
    On my website, you will be able to customize or send me an image of a piece of clothing that you want me to design for you and
     send me an image of clothing that you want me to alterate for you if you like. Thank you for all your support and enjoy!</p>
